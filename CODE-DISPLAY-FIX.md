# ðŸ”§ Code Display Fix - Chat Updates

## The Issue
After using chat to fix code issues (like sword positioning), the updated code wasn't displaying properly. The success message would show but the actual code was missing or invisible.

## The Fix
I've made several improvements:

### 1. **Better State Management**
- Reset `isFixed` and `showErrors` when code changes
- This prevents old success/error messages from interfering

### 2. **Improved Code Display**
- Added fallback to show either `displayCode` or `code`
- Set explicit background color and styling
- Added minimum height to prevent collapse

### 3. **Chat Integration**
- Added console logging to track code updates
- Show success message in chat when code updates
- Force re-render after code changes

### 4. **Visual Feedback**
- "Code updated successfully!" message in logs
- "âœ… Code updated!" message in chat
- Clear indication that code has been modified

## How It Works Now

1. **You report an issue**: "The sword is above the player's arm"
2. **Chat processes**: Shows the assistant's explanation
3. **Code updates**: The fixed code replaces the old code
4. **Visual confirmation**: 
   - Success message in chat
   - Updated code displays immediately
   - Syntax validation runs automatically

## Troubleshooting

If code still doesn't show:
1. Check browser console for "Updating code from chat" message
2. Look for the code length in console
3. Try switching tabs and back to "Generated Code"
4. Refresh the page if needed

The code display should now properly show updated code from chat interactions! ðŸš€
