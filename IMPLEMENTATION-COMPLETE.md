# 🎉 Implementation Complete!

Your Roblox code generator UI is now fully connected and working! Here's everything that's been implemented:

## 🔌 What's Connected:

### 1. **Frontend → Backend Connection**
- The UI sends prompts to `/api/generate`
- Includes script type selection (Server/Client/Module)
- Real-time streaming of results

### 2. **Backend → Claude Code SDK**
- API route calls the Roblox code generator
- Uses `bypassPermissions` for automatic generation
- Streams messages back to the frontend

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- Shows Claude's thinking process
- Displays generation progress
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🚀 To Run Everything:

1. **Set your API key** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd roblox-lovable-ui
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000

## 📝 Features You Can Test:

### Input Options:
- **Script Type Selector**: Choose Server, Client, or Module
- **Text Input**: Enter any Roblox game idea
- **Real-time placeholders**: Rotating suggestions

### Output Display:
- **Generated Code tab**: Syntax-highlighted Luau code
- **Generation Process tab**: See Claude's thinking
- **Copy button**: Copy code to clipboard
- **Download button**: Save as .lua file

### Console Logs:
Open browser console (F12) to see:
- 🚀 Generation start
- 📡 API responses
- 📦 Streaming data
- ✅ Success messages
- ❌ Error details

## 🧪 Example Prompts to Try:

1. **Server Script**: 
   - "Create a spawn system that teleports players to random locations"
   - "Build a leaderboard that tracks player scores"

2. **Client Script**:
   - "Create a sprint system with shift key"
   - "Make a health bar GUI"

3. **Module Script**:
   - "Create an inventory system"
   - "Build a weapon class with damage calculation"

## 🎨 What You'll See:

1. **Gradient background** with floating orbs
2. **Script type selection** with visual feedback
3. **Loading animation** during generation
4. **Code display** with syntax highlighting
5. **Process logs** with timestamps
6. **Smooth animations** throughout

The system is fully functional and ready to generate Roblox scripts from natural language prompts!
