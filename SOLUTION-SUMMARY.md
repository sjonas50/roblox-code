# ðŸŽ¯ Solution for Claude Code SDK Error

## The Problem
The error "Unexpected end of JSON input" occurs because the Claude Code SDK needs to spawn the `claude-code` CLI as a subprocess, but it can't find it.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Install Claude Code CLI Globally
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then restart your Next.js server and try again.

### Solution 2: Update to Direct API Route
The frontend is already updated to use `/api/generate-direct` which should handle this better.

### Solution 3: Manual Testing
Test if the generator works standalone:

```bash
cd roblox-claude-codegen
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key npm run dev test-basic.ts
```

If this works, the issue is with the Next.js integration.

## What I've Done to Fix It

1. **Added better error logging** - You'll see more detailed errors in the console
2. **Created alternative API route** - `/api/generate-direct` that uses the SDK differently  
3. **Updated generator to use local CLI** - It now looks for the CLI in node_modules
4. **Added debugging info** - More console logs to track where it fails

## Quick Test

After installing the CLI globally, try this in your browser console:
```javascript
fetch('/api/generate-direct', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: 'Create a simple print statement',
    scriptType: 'server'
  })
}).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log)
```

You should see streaming responses in the console.

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check the API key is set in `.env.local`
2. Make sure you restarted the Next.js server after setting the key
3. Try running `claude-code --version` to verify the CLI works
4. Check the browser console and terminal for detailed error messages

The core issue is that the Claude Code SDK needs its CLI component to be available. Once that's resolved, everything should work!
