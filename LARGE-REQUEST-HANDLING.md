# üîß Large Request Handling - Fixed!

## The Issue
When you make large requests like "create a racing game with checkpoints and timers. add all assets needed for this", the Claude Code SDK can fail with:
- `Unexpected end of JSON input`
- Response truncation
- Generation timeout

## The Fix
I've implemented several solutions:

### 1. **Better Error Messages**
When a request is too large, you'll now see a helpful message:
```
The request was too complex. Try breaking it down:

1. First ask for the basic racing game mechanics
2. Then ask to add the checkpoint system
3. Finally ask for timers and UI

Example: "Create a basic racing game with a car that can move"
```

### 2. **Automatic UI Recovery**
- The Generate button will **always** be re-enabled after errors
- Added a 30-second safety timeout
- The `done` event is sent even after errors

### 3. **Debug Information**
In development mode, you can see:
- Current `isGenerating` state
- Prompt length
- Console logs for troubleshooting

## How to Handle Large Projects

### ‚ùå Don't Do This:
```
"create a complete racing game with checkpoints, timers, leaderboards, 
multiple cars, power-ups, different tracks, UI, sound effects, 
particle effects, and all assets"
```

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead:

**Step 1: Core Mechanics**
```
"Create a basic racing game with a car that can move forward and turn"
```

**Step 2: Add Features (via Chat)**
After generating the base code, use the chat panel:
- "Add a checkpoint system that players must pass through"
- "Add a timer that tracks lap times"
- "Add UI to show current speed and lap time"

**Step 3: Polish**
- "Add particle effects when the car boosts"
- "Add sound effects for engine and collisions"

## Using the Chat Panel for Iterations

The chat panel is perfect for building complex projects incrementally:

1. Generate the base code with a simple prompt
2. Click the blue chat button
3. Add features one at a time:
   ```
   User: "Add 3 checkpoints that the player must pass in order"
   Assistant: "I'll add a checkpoint system..."
   
   User: "Now add a lap timer that resets when completing a lap"
   Assistant: "I'll add the timer functionality..."
   ```

## Technical Details

### Why This Happens
- The Claude Code SDK has response size limits
- Complex requests generate very long responses
- JSON parsing fails when responses are truncated

### Prevention
- Keep initial prompts focused on core functionality
- Use the chat panel for incremental improvements
- Break down complex features into smaller parts

## Quick Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the most basic version
2. **Iterate**: Use chat to add features one by one
3. **Be Specific**: Instead of "add all assets", specify what you need
4. **Test Often**: Generate and test each feature before adding more

The system is now more robust and will guide you to success even with complex projects! üöÄ
