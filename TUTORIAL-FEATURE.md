# 📖 Tutorial Feature - Complete!

I've added a comprehensive tutorial system that shows users exactly how to implement their generated code in Roblox Studio!

## ✨ What's New

### 1. **"How to Use" Tab**
After code generation, you'll see a new "📖 How to Use" tab that provides:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Prerequisites
- Testing guidance
- Troubleshooting tips

### 2. **Smart Code Analysis**
The tutorial generator analyzes your code to understand:
- What Roblox objects are needed (Parts, Tools, GUIs)
- Which services are used

### 3. **Context-Aware Instructions**
Based on your script type and code content:
