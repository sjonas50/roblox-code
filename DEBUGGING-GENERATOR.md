# 🔍 Debugging the Generator Issue

The error "Unexpected end of JSON input" is occurring when trying to generate code. Here's what I've done to debug:

## 1. Added Enhanced Logging
- More detailed error messages
- Message count tracking
- Stack trace logging

## 2. Test Steps

### Option A: Test via Browser
1. Restart your Next.js server to pick up the changes:
   ```bash
   cd roblox-lovable-ui
   # Ctrl+C to stop, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Try generating again and check the terminal for new logs:
   - 📤 Sending query to Claude Code SDK...
   - 📨 Received message X: [type]
   - 🔴 Generator error details

### Option B: Direct Test
Visit http://localhost:3000/api/test-generator in your browser to run a simple test.

## 3. Possible Issues

The "Unexpected end of JSON input" error typically means:
- The Claude Code SDK is receiving an incomplete response
- The API key might not be properly configured
- There could be a timeout issue (it takes ~60 seconds)

## 4. Things to Check

1. **API Key**: Make sure your `.env.local` file has:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```

2. **Claude Code SDK Version**: The SDK might need to be run differently. Try running this test directly:
   ```bash
   cd roblox-claude-codegen
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here npm run dev test-basic.ts
   ```

3. **Next.js Environment**: Sometimes Next.js doesn't pass environment variables correctly. You might need to restart the server after setting the API key.

Please try generating again and share the new console logs - they should give us more information about where exactly the error is occurring.
