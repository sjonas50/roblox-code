# 🔌 UI Connection Complete!

The UI is now fully connected to the Roblox code generator. Here's what I've implemented:

## ✅ Features Added:

### 1. **API Route Connection**
- Created `/api/generate` endpoint that connects to the Roblox code generator
- Implements Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming
- Handles errors gracefully

### 2. **Code Output Display**
- Syntax-highlighted code display using `react-syntax-highlighter`
- Two tabs: "Generated Code" and "Generation Process"
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Download as .lua file
- Shows filename and script type

### 3. **Real-time Generation Process**
- Shows Claude's "thinking" process in the logs tab
- Timestamped messages
- Color-coded messages (info, assistant, success, error)
- Loading animations during generation

### 4. **Script Type Selection**
- Three buttons to choose: Server, Client, or Module script
- Visual feedback for selected type
- Passes script type to the generator

### 5. **Console Logging**
- Extensive console logs for debugging:
  - 🚀 Generation start
  - 📡 API response status
  - 📦 Received data chunks
  - ✅ Completion status
  - ❌ Error messages

## 🧪 How to Test:

1. Make sure both terminals are running:
   - Terminal 1: `cd roblox-lovable-ui && npm run dev`
   - Terminal 2: Your Anthropic API key should be set

2. Open http://localhost:3000

3. Try these test prompts:
   - "Create a part that changes color when touched"
   - "Build a teleport system between two parts"
   - "Make a shop GUI with buy buttons"

4. Watch the console in your browser (F12) for detailed logs

5. Click "Generation Process" tab to see Claude's thinking

## 🎯 What Happens:

1. Enter prompt → Click Generate
2. API route receives request
3. Calls Roblox code generator with Claude Code SDK
4. Streams results back to UI
5. Shows code with syntax highlighting
6. Displays generation process in logs

The connection is complete and working! You should see:
- Console logs in browser
- Generated code displayed
- Process logs in the Generation Process tab
- Ability to copy/download the code
