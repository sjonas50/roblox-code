# Enhanced Chat System Guide

## Overview
The chat system has been upgraded to intelligently handle both Q&A and code modifications. It now analyzes user intent to provide the most appropriate response.

## How It Works

### Intent Detection
The chat analyzes your message to determine if you're:
- **Asking a question** (how, what, why, where, when, can, should, explain)
- **Reporting an error** (mentions of "error", "ServerScriptService", "attempt to", "nil")
- **Requesting changes** (make, add, change, update, modify, fix, create, implement)

### Response Types

#### 1. Questions Only (No Code Changes)
When you ask questions, the chat will:
- Provide detailed explanations and guidance
- NOT modify your existing code
- Help you understand implementation details

**Examples:**
- "How do I implement this in Roblox Studio?"
- "Where should I place this script?"
- "Can you explain how the touched event works?"
- "What's the difference between server and client scripts?"

#### 2. Code Modifications
When you request changes, the chat will:
- Modify your code as requested
- Show the updated code in a new version
- Explain what changes were made

**Examples:**
- "Make the part spin faster"
- "Add a sound effect when touched"
- "Change the color to blue"
- "Fix this error: attempt to index nil with 'Name'"

#### 3. Error Fixes
When you report errors, the chat will:
- Analyze the error message
- Provide a fixed version of the code
- Explain what caused the error and how it was fixed

**Examples:**
- "I'm getting this error: ServerScriptService.Script:5: attempt to index nil with 'Parent'"
- "The script says 'Humanoid is not a valid member of Model'"

## Tips for Best Results
