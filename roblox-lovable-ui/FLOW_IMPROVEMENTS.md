# Project Flow Improvements

## Overview
The project flow has been significantly improved to be more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Key Improvements

### 2. Streamlined Project Creation
- Removed the jarring transition between single-script and project mode

### 3. Better Empty States
Instead of generic "create script" messages:
- **Empty Project**: Shows 3 quick-create buttons for common script types
- **No Project**: Friendly welcome with clear call-to-action
- Visual icons and helpful tips guide users

Quick-create options that bypass the modal:
