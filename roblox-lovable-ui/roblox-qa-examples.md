## Tips for Clear Communication

### When Asking Questions:
- Be specific about what you want to understand
- Mention if you're new to Roblox development
- Ask about concepts, not just "how to fix"

### When Requesting Changes:
- Use action words: add, create, modify, implement
- Describe the desired behavior clearly
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### Examples of Clear vs Unclear:
❌ "doesn't work"
✅ "How do I debug why the touched event isn't firing?"

❌ "make better"
✅ "Add particle effects when the player collects the coin"

❌ "help with teams"
✅ "How do I make this script only work for players on the blue team?"
