## Basic Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Creating Your First Interactive Part

**Goal**: Make a part that players can interact with

1. **Generate the Code**
   ```
   Prompt: "Create a red part in the workspace that turns green when touched 
            and gives the player 10 points"
   ```

2. **Understanding the Generated Code**
   ```lua
   -- The AI will generate something like:
   local part = Instance.new("Part")
   part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Really red")
   part.Size = Vector3.new(4, 4, 4)
   part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 5, 0)
   part.Parent = workspace

   part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
       -- Code to handle touch
   end)
   ```

3. **Customizing with Chat**
   - Click the chat button
   - Ask: "Make the part float up and down"
   - The AI adds animation to your existing code

### Tutorial 2: Creating a Simple Shop

**Goal**: Build a shop where players can buy items

1. **Start with a Template**
   - Create new project
   - Choose "Shop System" template
   - Review the generated scripts

2. **Customize the Shop**
   ```
   Chat: "Add a speed boost item that costs 50 coins and lasts 30 seconds"
   ```

3. **Create the Shop GUI**
   ```
   New Script → Client Script
   Prompt: "Create a shop GUI that shows the items from the shop system 
            with buy buttons"
   ```

4. **Test the Integration**
   - Server script in ServerScriptService
   - Client script in StarterGui
   - They work together automatically!

### Tutorial 3: Building a Team-Based Game

**Goal**: Create a capture-the-flag style game

1. **Set Up Teams**
   ```
   Use Template: "Team System"
   This gives you auto-balancing teams
   ```

2. **Add Team Spawns**
   ```
   Prompt: "Create team spawn locations that teleport players to their 
            team's base when they join"
   ```

3. **Create the Flag System**
   ```
   Prompt: "Create a flag system where each team has a flag. When a player 
            touches the enemy flag, they carry it. If they bring it to 
            their base, their team scores"
   ```

4. **Add Scoring**
   ```
   Chat: "Add a leaderboard that shows team scores and announce when 
          a team scores"
   ```

## Working with the Chat

### When to Use Chat vs New Generation

**Use Chat for:**
- Fixing errors
- Adding features to existing code
- Asking questions
- Making small modifications

**Generate New for:**
- Completely different systems
- Starting fresh
- Different script types

### Effective Chat Prompts

#### Fixing Errors
```
"I'm getting this error: ServerScriptService.Script:12: attempt to index nil 
 with 'Humanoid' - please fix"
```

#### Adding Features
```
"Add a visual effect when the player collects a coin - make it sparkle and 
 float up"
```

#### Asking Questions
```
"How do I make this script work for all players instead of just one?"
```

#### Optimizing Code
```
"This script is causing lag when many players use it - can you optimize it?"
```

### Chat Understands Context

The chat remembers:
- Your current code
- Previous changes
- What you're trying to build

So you can say things like:
- "Make it bigger"
- "Add sound to that"
- "Make it work with teams"

## Tips and Tricks

### 1. Generate Incrementally
Instead of:
```
"Create a complete RPG game with inventory, combat, quests, shops, and bosses"
```

Do:
```
Step 1: "Create basic combat system"
Step 2: "Add inventory system"
Step 3: "Create quest system"
etc.
```

### 2. Be Specific
Instead of:
```
"Make a gun"
```

Try:
```
"Create an automatic rifle that shoots 10 bullets per second, each dealing 
 15 damage, with 30 bullet clips and 2 second reload time"
```

### 3. Test Often
1. Generate code
2. Test in Studio
3. Fix issues with chat
4. Add next feature

### 4. Use Script Types Correctly
- **Server**: Game logic, security, data
- **Client**: User input, UI, effects
- **Module**: Shared code, utilities

### 5. Learn from Generated Code
- Read the comments
- Understand the structure
- Ask chat to explain complex parts

### 6. Organize Your Projects
```
My Obby Game/
├── Checkpoints (Server)
├── ObbyUI (Client)
├── LavaScript (Server)
└── TimerDisplay (Client)

My RPG/
├── CombatSystem (Module)
├── Inventory (Server)
├── InventoryUI (Client)
└── QuestManager (Server)
```

### 7. Common Patterns

#### Client-Server Communication
```
Prompt: "Create a RemoteEvent system for the shop where the client 
         requests to buy an item and the server validates and processes it"
```

#### Modular Systems
```
Prompt: "Create this as a module script that other scripts can use by 
         requiring it"
```

#### Event-Driven Design
```
Prompt: "Make this system fire custom events that other scripts can 
         listen to"
```

## Quick Reference

### Script Placement
- **Server Scripts**: ServerScriptService
- **Client Scripts**: StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts
- **Module Scripts**: ReplicatedStorage
- **GUIs**: StarterGui
- **Tools**: StarterPack

### Common Services
```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")
local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
```

### Performance Tips
1. Use `task.wait()` instead of `wait()`
2. Disconnect unused connections
3. Avoid `while true do` without yields
4. Cache frequently accessed objects
5. Use RemoteEvents sparingly

### Security Reminders
1. Never trust the client
2. Validate all RemoteEvent data
3. Check permissions server-side
4. Don't expose sensitive data
5. Rate limit client requests
