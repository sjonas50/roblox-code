# ðŸ”§ Fix for "Unexpected end of JSON input" Error

## The Issue
The Claude Code SDK requires the Claude Code CLI to be installed globally, but it's not installed.

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Claude Code CLI Globally
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
claude-code --version
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Next.js Server
```bash
cd roblox-lovable-ui
# Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Try Again
The generation should now work properly!

## Alternative: Use Direct API

If you prefer not to install globally, I've created a direct API route that uses the SDK differently. The frontend is already updated to use `/api/generate-direct`.

## Why This Happened

The Claude Code SDK works by spawning a subprocess (`claude-code` CLI) and communicating via JSON streams. When the CLI isn't installed, the subprocess fails to start, resulting in empty output that causes the JSON parsing error.

## Testing

After installing the CLI, try these prompts:
1. "Create a part that changes color"
2. "Build a teleport system"
3. "Make a shop GUI"

You should now see:
- Code generated successfully
- Generation process in the logs tab
- No more JSON parsing errors
